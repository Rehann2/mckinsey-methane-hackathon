## Description
The app is divided in three portals :

### Methane detection

The goal of this display is to detect the presence of methane in a satellite image.
The user can either use one of the demo images, or upload a .tif image of his choice. 

Different models are available for comparison, and a heatmap can also be shown over the image to highlight the most important datapoints - i.e. the plume, in the case of presence of methane.

### Metadata analysis 

This page provides an analysis of already available data on methane leakages in various areas. It has two main parts:

1/ A map showing where available images are located, with a red dot for methane leakages and a green one for clean areas

2/ A deep-dive of each location available, with its coordinates, methane detection history and appropriate dataframe.
It also gives the possibility to explore new locations given coordinate points.

### CleanR workspace

This dashboard is meant to be used by CleanR only. 

For each location available - or any new location of your choice -, it will provide the company with potential customers and partners in the area, to work together on solving methane-related issues.
